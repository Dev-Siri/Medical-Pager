# Medical-Pager

Medical Pager is a Chat application made with Stream, React (compiles prod with Preact) & Node.js + Fastify.

## Technologies

- Stream
- React
- Preact (compilation step)
- Node
- Fastify

## Why not use Preact directly?

`stream-chat-react` doesn't support Preact so I am unable to directly use Preact.

## Getting started

- Clone

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Dev-Siri/Medical-Pager.git
```

- Install

```sh
$ pnpm i
```

- Run

```sh
$ pnpm dev
```
